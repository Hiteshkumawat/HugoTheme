I'm a product designer who loves to write code. I'm interested about connecting design and development and giving creators the resources they require to do tasks more effectively and quickly. I'm quite interested in Design Systems and Design Tokens; if you're working on something cool in this space, I'd love to hear from you!

Outside of work, I enjoy developing free materials that help creative people in their process or journey. Along with teaching Figma, I also cover the basics of UI/UX with young design students.
